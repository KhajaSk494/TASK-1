# Overview Of This Project

## Project : WEB APPLICATION TESTING WITH SELENIUM

## Objective

### To Automate The Process Of Testing Web Applications to Improve Efficiency and Coverage.Web Applications Such As Google Forms.etc.,

# Project Activities

## Project Planning and Setup

- **Determine the Goals of the Testing Project:**
  - Identify the main objectives and purpose of the testing initiative.
  - Define what success looks like for the testing project.

- **Identify the Functionalities and Features to Be Tested:**
  - List out the key features and functionalities of the application that need to be validated.
  - Ensure all critical areas of the application are covered in the testing plan.

## Test Design and Strategy

- **Analyze Requirements and User Stories to Define Test Scenarios:**
  - Review project requirements and user stories to understand what needs to be tested.
  - Develop test scenarios that reflect real-world usage and edge cases.

- **Develop Detailed Test Cases:**
  - Create comprehensive test cases that cover both functional and non-functional requirements.
  - Include test steps, expected results, and any necessary test data.

## Test Execution and Validation

- **Execute the Selenium Test Scripts Across Different Browsers and Environments:**
  - Run automated test scripts using Selenium WebDriver on various browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and operating systems.
  - Ensure the application behaves consistently across different environments.

- **Monitor the Execution for Any Issues or Failures:**
  - Observe the test execution process to identify any issues or failures.
  - Address any problems encountered during testing and verify that issues are resolved.

## Reporting and Analysis

- **Produce Detailed Test Reports:**
  - Generate test reports that summarize the test execution results.
  - Include test results, logs, and screenshots to provide a comprehensive view of test outcomes.

- **Analyze Test Results:**
  - Review the test reports to analyze the test results.
  - Identify patterns in test failures, investigate root causes, and document findings.

# INSTALLATION GUIDE

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up your environment to run automation tests using Selenium with Python and ChromeDriver.

## 1. Installation of Python

1. **Download Python:**
   - Visit the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Download the latest version of Python suitable for your operating system.

2. **Install Python:**
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
   - **Important:** Ensure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to check if Python is installed correctly:

     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

   - You should see the Python version number printed.

4. **Install pip (Python Package Installer):**
   - Pip is included with Python installations starting from Python 3.4. If not already installed, you can install it using:

     ```bash
     python -m ensurepip --upgrade
     ```

## 2. Installation of ChromeDriver

1. **Download ChromeDriver:**
   - Visit the ChromeDriver download page: [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads)
   - Download the version of ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser version.

2. **Extract the ChromeDriver:**
   - Extract the downloaded file to a directory on your system.

3. **Add ChromeDriver to PATH:**
   - **On Windows:**
     - Copy the path to the ChromeDriver executable (e.g., `C:\path\to\chromedriver.exe`).
     - Add this path to your system's PATH environment variable.

     ```bash
     setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\path\to\chromedriver"
     ```

   - **On macOS/Linux:**
     - Move the ChromeDriver executable to `/usr/local/bin` or another directory included in your PATH:

     ```bash
     sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
     ```

     - Ensure the file is executable:

     ```bash
     sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
     ```

4. **Verify ChromeDriver Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to verify ChromeDriver is correctly installed:

     ```bash
     chromedriver --version
     ```

   - You should see the ChromeDriver version number printed.

## 3. Execution of Commands for Automation Testing

1. **Install Selenium Python Library:**
   - Install the Selenium package using pip:

     ```bash
     pip install selenium
     ```

2. **Create a Test Script:**
   - Create a Python file (e.g., `test_script.py`) and add the following sample code:

     ```python
     from selenium import webdriver

     # Set up ChromeDriver
     driver = webdriver.Chrome()

     # Navigate to a webpage
     driver.get('https://www.example.com')

     # Print the title of the page
     print(driver.title)

     # Close the browser
     driver.quit()
     ```

3. **Run the Test Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where your test script is located.
   - Execute the script using Python:

     ```bash
     python test_script.py
     ```

   - You should see the title of the webpage printed in the terminal, and the browser should open and close automatically.
